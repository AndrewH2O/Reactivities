See changes to API
-----


As we are StrictMode in development mode The Api is run twice.
A UseEffect is executed twice, The components mounts and calls the api and then
tests cleanup code inside useEffect, this calls useEffect again calling
to our api a second time. We don't have a cleanup function but the UseEffect
is still run twice


type definitions
----------------
index.d.ts        under lib/types

use this site to copy json returned from a query so that we 
avoid typos https://transform.tools/json-to-typescript

typescript can then infer the type elsewhere once we define type in useState
