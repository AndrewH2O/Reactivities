As we are StrictMode in development mode The Api is run twice.
A UseEffect is executed twice, The components mounts and calls the api and then
tests cleanup code inside useEffect, this calls useEffect again calling
to our api a second time. We don't have a cleanup function but the UseEffect
is still run twice
