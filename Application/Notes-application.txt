CQRS
----
CQRS Command Query Responsibility Separation
    Flow of data
                       Command             Query
Does something           yes               no
Answers Question         no                yes    
State change             yes               no
Return a value           no                yes

In this APP we have one db
API -> Command -> Domain -> Persistence -> DB (write ops)
DB (read ops)  ->  Query  -> API
Eventual Consistency   DB (write ops) -> DB (read ops)

Read db could be de-normalised
