Use

dotnet watch

Nullable flag in new dotnet projects, when sets to true means we get warnings
on all ref types if they could be null then it is up to us to specify if they could be null or nullable.
Previous behaviour was to make ref types nullable by default.

Add via nuget following packages
In persistence project: 
    microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.sqlite
In API project: 
    microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.design
    
    
EF
globally install tools (Rider uses this so installed it) Used tooling inside Rider for this
        dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 9.0.0
        
 initial migration
    dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API 
    
    -p project where dbcontext is
    -s where startup project is
    
    then to apply the migration:
     dotnet ef database update -p Persistence -s API 
   
 We dropped database 
 dotnet ef database drop -   
    dotnet ef database drop -p Persistence -s API
